#Copy Package.json file to working dir into docker container (whenever, this dockerfile runs, firs it will check, is there any changes into this file, if yes then and then only it will run "npm install command", by doing this build command will take lesser time (kind of "image layer OR image optimization") )

#This is optional but good for best practice (real one is when we run "docker run -p :xx:xx")

#Now, run node main file whatever declared as "main" key into package.json file (here for eg. 'server.js')
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
